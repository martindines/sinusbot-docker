# SinusBot Docker image with yt-dlp

SinusBot is typically installed alongside youtube-dl, a tool used to download content from Youtube and other platforms. The youtube-dl project sees little development, and download speeds are increasingly slowing down (often throttled at 70KiB/s). This container replaces youtube-dl with yt-dlp, an indirect fork of youtube-dl, which aims to add new features and patches and offers greatly improved download speeds.
